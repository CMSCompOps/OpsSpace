ToolBox Modules
===============

The CompOps tool box contains a number of modules that may be useful for
multiple projects and tools.
Most of the functions in here will be (hopefully) monitoring tools
that are maintained by the experts and used by the masses.

.. note::

  At the moment, we just have some basic tools that are used
  by the setup script and WorkflowWebTools.
  Edit :file:`OpsSpace/docs/toolbox.rst` to add your module to this page!.
