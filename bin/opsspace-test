=pod

The script ``opsspace-test`` will run a set of tests, as described below.
It assumes a particular project directory structure that looks like the following:

  .
  |-- setup.py
  |-- packagename
  |   |-- __init__.py
  |   `-- ...
  |-- test
  |   |-- requirements.txt  (optional)
  |   |-- pylint.cfg        (optional)
  |   |-- test_*
  |   `-- ...
  `-- docs
      |-- requirements.txt  (optional)
      |-- conf.py
      `-- ...

``opsspace-test`` must be run in the root directory of such a project.  

The script can be run with two different ways of configuring behavior.
The first way is to specify which tests are run.
The other way is to set certain environment variables.

=head1 Test Names

A subset of tests can be run.
This is done by selecting from the tests below and adding them as arguments to this script.
If no arguments are given, all of the following tests are run.

  - **docs** - This test does nothing if the Python version is 2.6.
    This is because Python 2.6 is not supported in Sphinx.
    This test is also skipped if the **nodoc** environment variable is set.
    Otherwise, this script looks in the local ``docs`` directory and installs any ``requirements.txt`` file found.
    (This is a good place to keep packages that are used to build documentation.)
    Then ``sphinx-build`` is run over the local ``docs`` directory.
    Any warning are considered errors, so this test will fail on documentation warnings.
  - **unit** - This runs over all of the executables that match the name ``test/test_*``.
    Before running those, it also installs any ``test/requirements.txt`` file that exists locally.
    If you need different requirements for Python 2.6, you can also create a file ``test/requirements26.txt``, and so on.
    The number of tests that fail are counted and reported at the end of the ``opsspace-test`` run.
  - **style** - This runs PyLint over the local Python package.
    This package name is determined as described under the **package** environment variable below.
    Usually, the correct package is found though.
    This PyLint check uses a default configuration that is found at the end of the ``opsspace-test`` script itself.
    If you wish to use a different PyLint configuration file, create a local ``test/pylint.cfg`` in your repository and
    ``opsspace-test`` will use that instead.
  - **twine** - This test does nothing if the Python version is 2.6.
    Otherwise, if a local ``setup.py`` file exists, this test will create a tarball for uploading to PyPI.
    It will then run ``twine check`` over the tarball.

The final exit code of the ``opsspace-test`` is how many of the tests above fail.
This means that it is easy to catch failing tests with Travis-CI, Jenkins, etc.

=head1 Environment Variables

Behavior is also modified by setting the following environment variables.

  - **package**: This should be the directory that the python source files are inside.
    This is used by the ``style`` test to determine what to run PyLint on.
    It is also used for renaming coverage results.
    If not set, it is determined by searching for an ``__init__.py`` file.
  - **nodoc**: If set, the ``docs`` test is skipped, even if the Python version is appropriate.
